Bananas or banannas? These are the top misspelled words in each state

 A previous version of this story stated Wisconsin's most misspelled word was "tomorrow" based on Google-provided data. A Google update with more current data found that the most misspelled word is actually Wisconsin. 

Spelling champions from across the country are preparing to compete this week at the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C.

While we've all cringed after misspelling a word in a work email or a text, the National Spelling Bee competitors will be asked to spell words that make the word "chihuahua" look like a walk in the park. 

In honor of those who aren't as gifted as the National Spelling Bee champs, Google pulled the most misspelled words in each state so far this year.
